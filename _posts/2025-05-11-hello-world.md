If you're in CS, you know every new project starts with "Hello World." So here it is - the first post on Future Proof!

## What took so long?

I've been meaning to start this blog for ages. Every time I'd learn something cool or solve a particularly frustrating problem, I'd think "I should write this down somewhere." Then I'd immediately get distracted by the next assignment, project, or existential crisis about whether I actually understand recursion.

But here we are. Blog attempt #5 (the last one stayed 6 months without a new post haha). This time it's actually happening.

## What to expect

I'm planning to use this space as a digital garden of sorts - a place to plant ideas, document my learning process, and occasionally rant about why certain programming languages make easy things unnecessarily complicated (looking at you, C++).

Some upcoming topics I'm thinking about:

- My adventures in building a custom mechanical keyboard that's probably too expensive for a student budget
- Notes from that distributed systems class that's currently melting my brain
- A breakdown of how I finally got my head around dynamic programming
- The time I spent three hours debugging only to find I had a semicolon where it shouldn't be

## An invitation

If you're reading this and you're also on this CS journey, I'd love to hear from you. What are you working on? What concepts are giving you trouble? What's the most elegant solution you've come up with recently?

Drop me an email or find me on GitHub. Maybe we can figure some things out together.

In the meantime, I should probably go study for that Compilers midterm...

Until next time,
