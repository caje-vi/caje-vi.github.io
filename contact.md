# Get In Touch

Whether you want to discuss a blog post, share your own CS struggles, or just say hello, I'd love to hear from you.

## Where to Find Me

### Social & Professional

- **GitHub**: [caje-vi](https://github.com/caje-vi)  
  Check out my projects, contributions, and probably a few repositories I started with enthusiasm and then abandoned.

- **LinkedIn**: [Jean V. Machado](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jean-vmachado)  
  Connect with me professionally, though fair warning: I only update this when I remember it exists.

### Direct Contact

- **Email**: [jeancarlosmachado@protonmail.com](mailto:jeancarlosmachado@protonmail.com)  
  The most reliable way to reach me. I check this regularly.

## Response Time

I'm usually pretty good about getting back to people within a day or two. If it's during midterms or finals, though, all bets are off.

## Collaborations

Interested in working together on a project? Have a cool coding challenge you want to tackle? I'm always open to collaborating with fellow CS enthusiasts. Just drop me a line with what you have in mind.

Looking forward to connecting!
