# Hey, I'm Jean Carlos

So I finally got around to making this blog. After ~three~ four false starts and a lot of procrastination, here we are!

I'm a CS student trying to make sense of this crazy field. Between debugging assignments at 3 AM and trying to understand why my algorithms professor thinks sorting problems are "fun", I figured I should document this journey somewhere.

## What's this blog about?

Honestly? It's mostly for me. A place to dump my thoughts, notes, and occasional breakthroughs when I finally understand something that's been driving me nuts. But if my struggles and small victories help someone else, even better!

You'll probably find:

- Notes from classes that actually clicked for me
- Projects I'm working on (both the ones that work and the spectacular failures)
- Cool papers or concepts I'm trying to wrap my head around
- Random coding problems that kept me up at night
